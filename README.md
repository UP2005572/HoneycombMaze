# Honeycomb Maze

## Overview

This project was created as a coursework project for the 'Programming Applications and Programming Langugages' module, second year BSc(Hons.) Compugter Science course at University of Portsmouth.

## Further Context

The main aim of this project was to use a decision based structure. This then lead me to recall the honeycomb maze concept most famously seen on Takeshi's castle. I therefore decided to imitate this.
